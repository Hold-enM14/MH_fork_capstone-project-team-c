# Project Title: 
Predicting Marathon Average Finishing Times: The Impact of Weather and Air Quality on the Boston Marathon

## Background: 
Weather conditions in the Boston Marathon vary greatly from year to year and can significantly affect runners’ performance.

This project explores how environmental factors—such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and air quality—impact average finishing times across different performance groups (elite, competitive, average, and slow runners). The goal is to determine whether these conditions can help predict how different groups of runners are affected by the environment in a given year.

Understanding these patterns can help:

- prepare medical officials and medical tents with support needs
- event organizers to prepare hydration and cooling stations in the most effective ways
- runners to prepare their pacing and set their expectations as a result of given weather conditions 


## Research Question: 
Can weather and environmental factors—such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and air quality—predict average finishing times across different performance groups (elite, competitive, average, and slow runners) in the Boston Marathon?

## Hypothesis & Predictions
 
**Hypothesis:** Poor weather conditions (e.g., higher temperatures, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, or worse air quality) are associated with slower average finishing times, particularly for non-elite runners.

**Predictions:**  Elite runners are expected to be less affected by challenging weather and air quality, while competitive, average, and slow runners will experience greater slowdowns as conditions worsen. Overall, favorable conditions—moderate temperatures, low humidity, and clean air—are associated with faster finishing times for all groups.
